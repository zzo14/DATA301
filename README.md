# DATA301 project

In this project, I research how the 2020 U.S. election is likely to impact the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.I use a Python library, which is nltk, for parsing semantics and the VADER algorithm to help me analyze the data I get from GDELT EVENT DATABASE and GDELT DOC API. With the new U.S. President Joe Biden taking a more cautious approach to the COVID-19, I think the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. has been better controlled.
